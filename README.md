# City Guess by Aaron Tylicki

## About
My first venture into Typescript and React. App inspired by GeoGuesser that uses street grids and landmarks on a map to make a guessing game for Global Cities.
This app was built using React and Typescript.

## Local Running
### Map Box API 
Create a [Map Box](https://www.mapbox.com/) account if you do not already have one. 

Create a file titled mapboxConfig.ts in the map component folder:
    `src/components/map/mapboxConfig.ts`

Add the following code with your [Map Box](https://www.mapbox.com/) api token in it to run locally:
    `export const mapboxApiToken = 'Insert Your API Key Here';`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br /> Open
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
